This is a code repository used in the control of the N3-ROV as final assignment material for an undergraduate course in acoustics, instrumentation and marine robotics, department of marine science and technology, faculty of fisheries and marine sciences, IPB University.

In this repo only front-end and back-end control is available because it is based on a local website so adjustments need to be made if you want to use it on a different ROV
